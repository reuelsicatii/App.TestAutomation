    <br>                <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>1. How long does it take to create a website?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        Our website development service normally completes within approximately 3 weeks for the Basic Web Design Package, approximately 3 to 4 weeks for the Basic Web Design plus Content Package, and depending on the scope of the web development, 4 to 6 weeks or more for the Advanced Web Design Package. Please note that these timelines can be met as long as all requirements (intake forms, payment, content, access credentials, etc.) are provided to us before the design phase begins.    </p>
    <h3>2. Will the web project start as soon as I make payment?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        Quality and speed of delivery are both important to us. Payment is part of the requirements needed to create the project timeline which defines the start date and finish dates of each stage of the web development cycle. Once we've received all requirements (intake forms, payment, content, access credentials, etc.), we can generate the project timeline within 24 hours. We highly recommend that all requirements are ready before payment as this helps our team complete the project within scope and the given timeline.    </p>
    <h3>3. What is the average cost for a website?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        There are many factors that influence the cost of any given website. Our packaged solutions range from $499 - $1499. In any event that your project requires more than what our packaged solutions offer, we would be happy to talk to you and provide you with a free assessment on any custom work your client needs.    </p>
    <h3>4. Does this include hosting?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        The website design packages do not include hosting. They only cover the website build and the site's launch as well as 10 days of support after final launch.    </p>
    <h3>5. What technologies do you use to build your websites?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        We use WordPress along with premium WordPress themes. Our themes are built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP. All our themes also use Page Builders which allow our clients to easily build pages, with unlimited layouts, through a drag and drop user interface, without the need for coding knowledge.    </p>
    <h3>6. Where will you build my website?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        We create a white label hosting environment for your clients. The URL will be provided to you once we've completed our initial QA.    </p>
    <h3>7. How many revisions can I get and what kind of revisions can I request for?</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 20px">        We value our client's insights and input. Your project includes two (2) revision rounds. The 1st round of revisions happens after the staging site or initial design is provided, your client be given 24 to 48 hours to provide all the design related revisions they need. The 2nd or last round of revisions happens after the content integration is completed and your client will is provided 24 to 48 hours to provide all the content related.    </p>
    <h3>8. Can I get access to my site while the site is being built?</h3>
